# Introduction
Technology and in particular today's Public Cloud platforms are evolving fast at an incredible pace while books are rather static with "release cycles" measured in years. Many technology books are already outdated they day they are published. This begs the question why anyone would want to read - let alone write - a book about one of the fastest moving targets in the information technology industry: Alibaba Cloud.

Having spent many years working with different cloud platforms it has become clear that the underlying principles and concepts of just about any cloud platform do not change half as fast as new services and features are being added about almost every single day.
These core concepts serve as the fundament for just about anything that's being built upon and offered by the platform. A thorough understanding and mastery of these concepts is crucial for successfully building and operating anything between a simple web application and the next bing thing with millions of users spread around the globe. Many of those concepts are valid for years and are only very carefully touched by the product groups that are building the cloud platform.

This book will dive deep on the core concepts of Alibaba Cloud, and best practices that have stood the test of time and have been successfully applied at many customer project. You will learn how and why things are working the way they are, and how and why you should do things in a certain way when using the Alibaba Cloud platform. Once you got the hang of the underlying principles, and the "Ali-way" of doing things, building, testing, monitoring, and operating will become much more enjoyable. It will also help you reason about the behavior and limitations of our big portfolio of managed services in the area of Big Data, IoT, Analytics, Compute, Storage, and Network.

Over the past years we had the joy of working with many different kinds of customers in different verticals, ranging from small startups, to big enterprise players. As broad and diverse as this range is, as similiar are the questions and uncertainties each and everyone of my customers had when they started building and operating real-world workloads on Alibaba Cloud. This book is the result of our accumulated experience we have gained during these years. Most of our Alicloud brain is in it. We hope that you will enjoy reading it and that it will help you in reaching your full potential with cloud-based solutions.
